**Operation**: `/sc:cleanup`  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## 📊 Cleanup Summary

### ✅ Tasks Completed

1. **Cache & Compiled Files Removal**
   - Removed all `__pycache__` directories (excluding venv)
   - Deleted `.pyc` and `.pyo` compiled Python files
   - Cleaned project-level cache directories

2. **Script Consolidation**
   - **Removed redundant scripts**:
     - `get_courses.py` (42 lines)
     - `demo_assignments_quizzes.py` (61 lines) 
     - `test_cleanup_verification.py` (73 lines)
   - **Created consolidated utility**: `scripts/canvas_demo.py` (130+ lines)
   - **Benefits**: Single demo script with multiple modes, better maintainability

3. **Documentation Organization**
   - **Moved documentation to `docs/` directory**:
     - `DEPLOYMENT_ENHANCED.md` → `docs/DEPLOYMENT_ENHANCED.md`
     - `SUPABASE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` → `docs/SUPABASE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - **Updated CLAUDE.md** with organized project structure and quick reference
   - **Benefits**: Centralized documentation, improved navigation

4. **Temporary File Cleanup**
   - Removed generated `active_courses.json` (will be recreated by demo script)
   - Cleaned temporary files (`.tmp`, `.DS_Store`)
   - Removed HTML coverage reports (regenerated on test runs)

5. **Project Structure Optimization**
   - Added clear directory structure to CLAUDE.md
   - Updated development commands with new script paths
   - Enhanced documentation quick reference

## 📈 Improvements Achieved

### 🎯 Code Organization
- **Reduced script redundancy**: 3 similar scripts → 1 comprehensive utility
- **Centralized documentation**: All guides in dedicated `docs/` directory
- **Clear project structure**: Visual directory tree in CLAUDE.md

### 🚀 Developer Experience
- **Single demo script**: `python scripts/canvas_demo.py` with multiple modes
- **Better documentation navigation**: Quick reference links in CLAUDE.md
- **Cleaner project root**: Moved documentation to subdirectory

### 🧽 Maintenance Benefits
- **Reduced duplication**: Eliminated 3 redundant demo scripts
- **Easier updates**: Single consolidated demo script to maintain
- **Better discoverability**: Organized documentation structure

## 🎛️ New Demo Script Usage

The consolidated `scripts/canvas_demo.py` provides multiple operation modes:

```bash
# Full demonstration (default)
python scripts/canvas_demo.py

# Specific actions
python scripts/canvas_demo.py --action courses     # Get active courses
python scripts/canvas_demo.py --action verify      # Verify client functions
python scripts/canvas_demo.py --action assessments # Demo assignments/quizzes
```
